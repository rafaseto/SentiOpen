       "  'body': '@roblourens I meet a similar issue. In my vscode extension, I previously use the below command to execute prompt with agent mode.\\n`await vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"workbench.action.chat.open\", { query: prompt, mode: \"agent\", });`\\n\\nHowever, I notice that the session history may impact my prompt. So I change my code to\\n```\\nawait vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"workbench.action.chat.open\"); // In case user doesn\\'t have chat open.\\nawait vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"workbench.action.chat.newEditSession\", { agentMode: true, inputValue: prompt });\\n        })\\n```\\nWith this code, I find that sometimes the operation will hang at the line of my core extension logic.\\n```\\nawait vscode.lm.invokeTool(toolName, options, token);\\n```\\n\\nI check the tool invoke logic and find that it rely on session to find out `editSession`. I just suspect if my code trigger two sessions and mixed them up.\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/2b7f830b37e0d103dfee3a561e4c8a1192587f54/src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/tools/editFileTool.ts#L54\\n\\nI also wonder what\\'s the correct way to open a new session to avoid the context being impact by history?',\n",

I was inspired to include it from other product docs, like [tailscale's](https://tailscale.com/kb/1286/macos-mdm#using-the-tailscale-profile-manifest)\\n\\nIt is a nicer experience for products that check in their plists to [their repo](https://github.com/DigiDNA/ProfileManifests/tree/imazing_standard/Manifests), but we probably don't want that maintenance overhead (at least until the number of policies stabilizes a bit)\\n\\nI'm OK removing it from the docs and leaving it up to sysadmins familiar with the space to utilize if they'd like.\",\n",

Assuming they should be printed to the `main` output channel, I don't see them when I restart vscode?\\n\\nMy process has been to:\\n- open insiders + devtools\\n- add infinite loop to `workbench.desktop.main.js` (just adding `while(true) {}` before the return in the run method)\\n- zoom in, vscode hangs, wait a while, see unresponsive dialog (_it takes quite a while to see the dialog, definitely more than 15s_)\\n- click reopen if the dialog comes up in a reasonable amount of time\\n\\nat this point, I kill vscode (if the dialog hasn't appeared), and upon restart/reopen there aren't any logs that I can see. All log levels are set to trace, so not sure what the intended flow is here.\",\n",

Once we have an established pattern we can do the same for custom instructions and prompt files (cc @legomushroom @aeschli)\\n\\nOne thought on the per-folder setup: I did get many customize-per-folder requests from mono-repo teams; but not often its _just one folder_ but they want to limit Copilot to _several folders_ that they usually work in.\\n\\nA solution that solves this and avoids fragmenting configs into multiple folders might be _glob_ patterns in _mcp.json_; which allows more dynamic rules.',\n",

       "  'body': '> Hi [@rperez030](https://github.com/rperez030) thank you for the issue. Can you reproduce this in VS Code stable?\\n\\nGood question. I cannot reproduce it in the stable version. I can reproduce it using macOS VoiceOver, but it is not as consistent as it is on Windows. I have to type very slowly, and it only seems to fail for the first few letters.\\n\\nTo adjust verbosity while typing in VoiceOver, open the VoiceOver Utility and navigate to Verbosity / Text. Under \"While Typing Speak,\" select \"Nothing.\" Alternatively, press VO + V anywhere in the system, press the right arrow until you hear \"Typing Echo,\" and use the up/down arrows to select \"Nothing.\"',\n",

Screenshot(s) would be appreciated\\n\\n> See the status of servers (starting/started/stopped/errored) and control their state\\n\\nInitial $0.02: MCP server status feels like the type of thing that should exist in another view / area (i.e. settings page) versus within the chat view. But would love anymore context / edge cases you might be thinking about for how/why/when you need to control MCP server state.\\n\\n> Enable and disable tools on a per-server and per-tool level\\n\\nAgreed. Might also potentially worth adding global enable/disable controls (assuming you weren\\'t already thinking about it) –– aka YOLO mode vibes.\\n\\nAnother idea: Could it be worth taking inspiration from Deno\\'s permission/security flags? Imagine being able to broadly enable/disable tools that access the file system, network, system environment, etc.\\n\\nOr we could even have some type of setting that will enforce a prompt is given to users before a tool with certain types of privileges is run. Example: \"Always show a confirmation prompt when a tool that has network privileges is about to be executed.\"\\n\\n> Have actions to help them install new extensions/MCP servers (for now this probably just opens docs until registries mature?), and we should be able to place more actions here in the future\\n\\nTo clarify, are we planning to offer the ability for MCP servers to be consumable as extensions (i.e. MCP server is packaged within an extension) _and_ in a \"raw\" format (for lack of a better term) like you find in directories such as the Cursor one?\\n\\nAlso if consumable in this \"raw\" format, is the idea that you could go to _any_ directory, follow the directions, and install an MCP server? Or will there be a more prescriptive / VS Code specific way of installing these servers? \\n\\n> There may be very many tools and mcp servers available, so there should be a filtering mechanism.\\n\\nRelated to grouping MCP servers by name / having tools with the same name, we should definitely have functionality/UI for name spacing tools when filtered.\\n\\nThe way we handle rendering `/` commands today is probably a good starting point / reference (i.e. list of commands with the associated chat participant listed along side the command name).\\n\\n<img width=\"563\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a5913e5-ecf0-476c-b1ea-3feefea0dd9b\" />\\n\\n> We should bear in mind that MCP servers can publish things other than tools that we may want to show in this UI in the future, though don\\'t over-index on that.\\n\\nOh this is great to know.

In any given conversation, the tools provider by a MCP server might never be used. Thus, there is no harm by a non-functioning MCP server.

Please help us out by providing a screen recording showing exactly what isn't working as expected. While we can work with most standard formats, `.gif` files are preferred as they are displayed inline on GitHub. You may find https://gifcap.dev helpful as a browser-based gif recording tool.\\n\\nIf the issue depends on keyboard input, you can help us by enabling screencast mode for the recording (`Developer: Toggle Screencast Mode` in the command palette). Lastly, please attach this file via the GitHub web interface as emailed responses will strip files out from the issue.\\n\\nHappy coding!\",\n",

It's so seamless using the AI in agent mode to set up the JSON file, read the docs, verify the install by trying a command, etc. Much preferable over the Cursor MCP installation method where you basically have to figure it out on your own and no good way to verify it's actually working.\\n- Config in the repo is good 👍. Config in my user settings would also be good 👍. I work in a wonderful world where I have to hop between around 200 small repos. I don't want to have to copy past my MCP servers into every one of those.\",\n",

For renderer, the flag is parsed at a different place https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/controller/blink_initializer.cc;l=154-157 and we just need to set that. That is why you don't see the crash when passing the flag via command line.\\n\\nI will bring back https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/242851/files and along with the existing runtime change it should cover all processes.\",\n",

       "  'body': '> I would suspect an issue with the particular extension\\n\\nThe extension is mine, I identified this issue while debugging it.\\n\\n> If the cancel action does not work then you would see the state you\\'re hitting\\n\\nThe test run does get canceled but the debug session does not stop (or restart) unless I call `debug.stopDebugging(session)`. If I click the stop button twice, it *will* stop, and if I click restart then click stop, it will restart. It seems very strange to me that the debug session doesn\\'t stop when the user clicks \"stop\" on the debug session.\\n\\nEven more bizarrely, I have to call `debug.stopDebugging(session)` *twice* to get restart to work. If I subscribe to `token.onCancellationRequested` and call stopDebugging once, then stopping works - I can click on the stop button and the run is canceled and the session stops. But restarting doesn\\'t work unless I duplicate the stopDebugging call. Not even with a timeout or anything, I literally just have to copy-paste the call so it happens twice.\\n\\nI\\'ve updated my extension to `await debug.startDebugging(...)` and then `const session = debug.activeDebugSession` instead of using `debug.onDidStartDebugSession` because the former is what the python extension does, but that seems racy to me: If the user does something to start two separate debug sessions in quick succession, isn\\'t it possible that `debug.activeDebugSession` will capture the wrong session?\\n\\nI see that the python extension does not have this same issue but I don\\'t see how I\\'m doing anything meaningfully different. Obviously the debug adapters are different but I turned on full logging of DAP and clicking the restart button doesn\\'t trigger any DAP messages if I comment out the stopDebugging calls.',\n",

Which means I have to resort to abominable code to capture the output, but that's a totally different complaint. The extension I'm working on is a semi-official companion to the vscode-go extension and the plan is to eventually merge it upstream (to vscode-go) but at least for now they're separate. I launch a `go` debug session and vscode-go handles the rest. vscode-go has a legacy adapter and a DAP adapter; if the test run is fed to the adapter factory I could submit a PR to vscode-go to kill the process when the test run ends, but that's not a good solution IMO because that means one component (the test controller in my extension) is dependent on the specific behavior of a different component (in a different extension).\\n\\n> I think we should also set `didTerminateTestRun = true` when restarting to avoid this case.\\n\\nI'd appreciate that, that way I could avoid the double call.\",\n",

In this case, the widget is always visible, with valid completions, as the user is backspacing, so adding that check does not fix this. \\n\\nWith this fixed #241765, we don't trigger when the cursor is at index 0, which seems like the only case where we don't want to show them, so I think we can close this?\\n\\nMaybe if users find it annoying to have suggestions while backspacing, we can add a setting to disable that behavior?\",\n",

       "  'body': '> Can you share reproduction steps in an empty profile? Thanks!\\n\\nI can confirm that with an empty profile you will be able to reproduce the problem by following these steps :\\n\\n1. Clone my 2 repos (https://github.com/dburnier/TPIntro1 and https://github.com/dburnier/TPIntro2) in an empty folder\\n2. From the TPintro1 subfolder apply these commands:\\n    a) git remote add another_remote https://github.com/dburnier/TPIntro2.git\\n    b) git merge --allow-unrelated-histories another_remote/main\\n3. Then from vscode (1.97.2 with an empty profile) open the TPIntro1 folder,  then open the main.c file needing to be resolved. If you click on \\'Resolve in Merge Editor\\'  button you will see the error \"The editor could not be opened due to an unexpected error. Please consult the log for more details.\" and you can check yourself the logs.\\n4. The same problem if you are opening the main.c from the Source control then \\'Resolve in Merge Editor\\'\\n\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb07b7fd-6ec3-431e-a538-0d107c74b853\" />\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5ecd19d-4c1b-41b7-950b-20130fa47a3e\" />\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/156c4504-403b-477c-9dba-a6775d880fbc\" />\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c82289f-65fa-47ae-a8b5-6303e967a4b5\" />\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be2e1fde-2e98-4c81-afda-a859940ceb2f\" />\\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/357366d4-f48c-4e7e-b2b4-9e8858251f41\" />',\n",

What is interesting are the calls to font cache that eventually leads to the direct write ipc calls which didn't happen so early with Electron 32.\\n\\nIt was then easy to find the recent changes in that code path and the behavior changed with the following feature enabled since Chromium 130 https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5848769. The feature flag has now been removed since Chromium 132 https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5964277 so we cannot disable it.\\n\\nThe crbug link associated with this feature is private, so I don't have much context on this feature. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5334708 is the change that originally added this feature. The gist seems that the font families are loaded early on startup to avoid relayout in prerenderers. The metrics validated are mostly related to page loads that happens after the browser starts hence it won't affect upstream. I will check if this affects PWA and see if I can bring back the feature flag to disable for embedders.\",\n",

It sounds like we have another issue to investigate. on Windows i hear something like: \"encode_image (function)  2 of 10\", but Voiceover only reads the symbol. another place where we use the same convention is the outline view inside Explorer (Explorer: Focus on Outline view command). This one work well in both platforms.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'Hi, just chiming in to say that I am experiencing a similar issue. If I just add `\"microsoft\": true` to my `extensions.allowed` section, the official c# extensions by Microsoft do not enable themselves when I open a C# project. They are listed when I enter `@disabled` into the extensions search bar.\\n\\nInterestingly if I go to the `settings.json` file, comment out `\"microsoft\": true`, save the file, uncomment and then save the file again the extensions load fine. If I specify each extension by its full name it also works fine as well.\\n\\nThis is  snippet of my `settings.json`. With this snippet in `settings.json` the following installed extensions are not enabled when a C# project is opened:\\n\\n- ms-dotnettools.csdevkit\\n- ms-dotnettools.csharp\\n- ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime\\n\\n```json\\n    \"extensions.allowed\": {\\n        // Specifying the extensions by full name works fine.\\n        // \"ms-dotnettools.csdevkit\": true,\\n        // \"ms-dotnettools.csharp\": true,\\n        // \"ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime\": true\\n        \\n        // Specifying just this policy causes the above extensions to be disabled.\\n        \"microsoft\": true\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nTo try to fix this issue I have clean installed VSCode multiple times, this does not seem to fix it. I am also experiencing the same thing with other official microsoft extensions such as the PYthon extension.\\n\\nAny help is much appreciated :)',\n",

Please see the images in my post above under the section `Applied via group policy`.  The remote ssh extension is allowed but the icon for remote explorer is missing. This doesn\\'t happen when the same setting is applied via the settings.json\\n\\nTo Reproduce\\n\\n- Disable group policy and install the remote ssh extension, the icon for remote expolorer should be now visible on the sidebar\\n- Create/Update the group policy in active directory for extensions allowed and use the following entry `{\"microsoft\": true}`  \\n- apply group policy on machine with running `gpupdate.exe` in terminal\\n- The icon for remote explorer will not be visible anymore but the extension itself will be shown as installed.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ll explain.\\nIn PHP world it\\'s common practice to have a blank line at the end of the file. And many files, being classes, end with a right brace `}` and a blank line. so now both JAWS and NVDA in VS Code read in speech and show in Braille the right brace on both lines, one where it does exist indeed, and another on the blank line. If you press the \"read current character\" key, you\\'ll hear \"blank\" or \"U+0\" as expected.\\nAny ideas if this is the same issue or should I open a new one? Thanks!',\n",

That means sometimes the output contains a stray `\\\\x1b]633;D;...`. When I first sat down to clean up Cline's `execute_command` output, initial testing showed that `633;D` was always included. After testing for a while I was confused as to why sometimes the regex pattern would match and sometimes it not, which caused this investigation. \\n\\nGiven the concern for consistency, it would be nice to guarantee that either extensions always get `;D`, or never get it. The consistency also raises concerns, as follows:\\n\\n1. Does vscode currently _guarantee_ that the command output stream is flushed and the _only_ thing that could possibly be lost is the `\\\\x1b]633;D` closing sequence?\\n2. Is it possible that the command could lose the tail of its output in the last chunk because of the race? \\n    1. For example is it possible for a chunk to contain `<foo>\\\\x1b]633;D` such that `<foo>` will be lost, especially when `<foo>` is it very large, a single line, and unbuffered?  \\n    2. We should also consider that, while it is very likely that the output of the closing sequence will happen in a single `read()` system call, this may not be guaranteed and may be necessary to support the possibility of terminal escape sequences split across multiple chunks. eg: `<large-unbuffered-one-line-data>\\\\x1b]633` followed by `;D`.\\n    3. While stdout/err is _probably_ flushed on program exit, and since `__vsc_command_complete` calls `printf '\\\\e]633;D\\\\a'` _after_ the command completes, the system call to `read()` from the terminal's file descriptor could possibly receive the data has chunks in the same read, separate reads, or even split at an unexpected buffer boundary: if the terminal integration code is already handling partial command output that may appear in same `read()` that contained `;633D`, then my concern in this bullet item is moot, but I would like to verify that since we are discussing the topic. \\n\\nCline's `execute_command` output has been unreliable for many releases, and I am trying to clean up Cline's exec code with something solid. For the moment, the workaround for both escape sequences in the testing code that has not yet released looks like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nlet match1 = output.match(/\\\\x1b\\\\]633;C\\\\x07(.*?)\\\\x1b\\\\]633;D(?:;(\\\\d+))?/s)?.[1]\\nlet match2 = output.match(/.*\\\\x1b\\\\]633;C\\\\x07(.*)$/s)?.[1]\\n\\nlet match = match1 !== undefined ? match1 : \\n           (match2 !== undefined ? match2 : undefined)\\n```\\n\\nThere are probably more efficient ways to match this, but implementation aside, you can see that we have some special cases implementing workarounds for whether `;D` exists or not. The special cases raised concern for other possible command output loss and led me to make an entire test plugin just to investigate the issue and open this ticket.\\n\\n**TL;DR:**\\n\\nUltimately I do not mind the special casing, as we are going to need it anyway to be compatible with existing versions of vscode that are already deployed: \\n\\nMy biggest concerns are those listed above in the interest of guaranteeing that no command output text is lost.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Hi @Tyriar and @TylerLeonhardt,\\n\\nI am testing the following multi-line command and getting strange response. I realize that multi-line commands will invoke the response of the shell integration escape codes _for each_ command, but I think you will find the result is even stranger than the expected behavior of the second command\\'s output being lost (because it occurs after the first command\\'s `\\\\x1b]633;D` terminator):\\n\\nThere have been users reporting no output: We only receive `\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07` followed by no output even though the command in the terminal did provide output, though I am not yet certain of the cause in cases. However, I have collected some samples which give strange behavior as shown below that hopefully point at the issue.\\n\\nYou can test with one of the multi-line command examples below with the https://github.com/KJ7LNW/vsce-test-terminal-integration test extension. I updated the extension to support multi-line input as the \"Command to run\", so do a pull if you have an older version.\\n\\nCan you reopen this issue since it is related, or would you prefer a new issue?\\n\\nTry these for the \"Command to run\":\\n\\n## Example 1 - incorrect behavior \\n```\\n# a big long comment \\necho \"some command following the comment \"\\n```\\n\\n### first invocation is correct \\nThe first invocation of this multi line command returns exactly `\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07`, which is expected because it is \"running\" the comment, which produces no output.  Output on the terminal produces the following, which is also expected:\\n\\n```\\n]$ # a big long comment \\n]$ echo \"some command following the comment \"\\nsome command following the comment \\n```\\n\\nNote that I do _not_ expect to receive \"some command following the comment\" from terminal integration, and I am not asking for multi-line command support in terminal integration to be officially supported. However, this edge case appears to highlight an actual bug somewhere, which is triggered in the **second** invocation, as follows:\\n\\n### second invocation is not correct \\n\\nThe second invocation of the following multi-line command returns `\\'\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07 the comment \"\\\\r\\\\n\\'`, which is _not_ expected. It should return exactly `\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07` because there is no change from the previous command (ie, the comment line provides no output), and the output from second command from the same shell integration execution is discarded because its output would occur after `\\\\x1b]633;D`, but the previous command seems to have some content that was partially queued in a shell integration buffer.\\n\\nAdditionally, the output to the terminator looks bizarre, this terminal output below the comment is completely unexpected and seemingly unrelated to shell integration escape sequences:\\n\\n```\\n]$ # a big long comment \\n the comment \"\\n]$ echo \"some command following the comment \"\\nsome command following the comment \\n```\\n\\nI am not sure how this bug could inject into the output buffer to the terminal the text ` the comment \"`, since the command does not, but what we are seeing in the second invocation is phantom \"output response\" from the comment line.\\n\\n## Example 2 - incorrect behavior \\n\\nthis is very similar to the previous example, but with different content:\\n\\n```\\n# Get information about the commit where we detected the version change\\necho \"Commit where version change was detected:\"\\n```\\n\\nThis is an actual example from an artificial intelligence attempting to run something with a comment above the command. The first invocation responds with exactly `\\'\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07` as you would expect, because the comment provides no output, but the second invocation returns `\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07hange was detected:\"\\\\r\\\\n` and again provides a strange terminal behavior which shows the spurious text `hange was detected:\"` in the terminal output as if the comment produced the text:\\n\\n```\\n]$ # Get information about the commit where we detected the version change\\nhange was detected:\"\\n]$ echo \"Commit where version change was detected:\"\\nCommit where version change was detected:\\n```\\n\\n## Example 3a - incorrect behavior \\n\\nthis is very similar to the previous example, but triggers the problem without a comment:\\n\\na `invalid command` followed by an echo. this effectively the same as the first two examples, but it highlights that a comment is not particularly special. it appears that it the termination of the first command somehow causes output from the first command to arrive in the second commands result:\\n\\n```\\ninvalid command \\necho this is a long echo test testing 12345 \\n```\\n\\nThe first in vocation is correct: `\\'\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07bash: invalid: command not found\\\\r\\\\n\\'`\\n\\nand produces this in the terminal:\\n```\\n]$ invalid command \\nbash: invalid: command not found\\n]$ echo this is a long echo test testing 12345 \\nthis is a long echo test testing 12345\\n```\\n\\nthe second invocation produces phantom output from the previous command, both in the terminal as if the command had printed `ting 12345` that it did not actually print:\\n\\n```\\n]$ invalid command \\nbash: invalid: command not found\\nting 12345 \\n]$ echo this is a long echo test testing 12345 \\nthis is a long echo test testing 12345\\n```\\n\\n### Example 3b - incorrect behavior \\n\\nthis example produces the same phantom output behavior, but with two valid commands (instead of a comment or an invalid command):\\n\\n```\\necho this is a very long message \\necho this an even longer message \\n```\\n\\n## Example 4 - \"correct\" behavior \\n\\nthis example has 3 blank lines above the command, which press enter in the terminal:\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\necho this is a long echo test testing 12345 \\n```\\n\\nWith the leading carriage returns above the command, it returns exactly \\'\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07\\' which I think is expected because the first \"command\" is a carriage return which prints the escape sequences and captures zero data, even though the output does contain text. Given the intended implementation of shell integration I think this is correct behavior, and prints as follows:\\n\\n```\\n]$ \\n]$ \\n]$ \\n]$ echo this is a long echo test testing 12345 \\nthis is a long echo test testing 12345\\n```\\n\\nAdditional invocations of the command produce the same empty result. The problem only appears to happen if two non-empty lines are passed to shell integration.  \\n\\n(I know that this could be mitigated with `.trim()`, but I am not trying to fix that problem, but rather to explain what we are seeing to help understand the phantom output problem in the other examples.)\\n\\n## Example 5 - correct behavior \\n\\nThis example shows that input with carriage returns is _not_ the problem. The following `cat` here document produces correct output repeatedly without anomaly:\\n\\n```\\ncat <<EOT\\nhello\\nworld\\nEOT\\n```\\n\\nproduces \\n\\n```\\n]$ cat <<EOT\\n> hello\\n> world\\n> EOT\\nhello\\nworld\\n```\\n\\n\\n## VSCE version\\n\\nI am running commit b7d674d3f420c3ca862cf3a315d52317fe475b4f which is newer than e380facb66e760f7702e995d8efd65a2ea09e07a which fixes the output problem:\\n\\n```\\nVersion: 1.98.0-insider\\nCommit: b7d674d3f420c3ca862cf3a315d52317fe475b4f\\nDate: 2025-02-26T05:04:34.242Z\\nElectron: 34.2.0\\nElectronBuildId: 11044223\\nChromium: 132.0.6834.196\\nNode.js: 20.18.2\\nV8: 13.2.152.36-electron.0\\nOS: Linux x64 6.6.67\\n```',\n",

Reproduction is simple:\\n\\n1. Load up https://github.com/KJ7LNW/vsce-test-terminal-integration\\n2. Run any command (`echo a`)\\n3. Type into the terminal, anything, just so it thinks `^C` is necessary\\n4. Click run command again --- we get only and exactly `\\\\x1B]633;C\\\\x07`, because (I think) `^C` triggers `633;D`\\n',\n",

It\\'s by design that \"empty command\" like when you SIGINT or press enter on nothing will trigger new executions. To fix it on your end you should make sure you\\'re actually listening to your execution. Here\\'s a diff to get it to work:\\n\\n```\\ndiff --git a/src/terminal/terminal-handler.ts b/src/terminal/terminal-handler.ts\\nindex c4221f1..6e7451b 100644\\n--- a/src/terminal/terminal-handler.ts\\n+++ b/src/terminal/terminal-handler.ts\\n@@ -219,7 +219,11 @@ export class TerminalHandler {\\n         }\\n         this.terminal.show();\\n \\n+        let execution: vscode.TerminalShellExecution | undefined;\\n         const startDisposable = (vscode.window as any).onDidStartTerminalShellExecution?.(async (e: any) => {\\n+            if (e.execution !== execution) {\\n+                return;\\n+            }\\n             console.log(\"onDidStartTerminalShellExecution triggered\", e)\\n             try {\\n                 const stream = e.execution.read();\\n@@ -364,6 +368,9 @@ export class TerminalHandler {\\n         });\\n \\n         const endDisposable = (vscode.window as any).onDidEndTerminalShellExecution?.(async (e: any) => {\\n+            if (e.execution !== execution) {\\n+                return;\\n+            }\\n             console.log(\"onDidEndTerminalShellExecution triggered\", e)\\n             if (e.terminal === this.terminal) {\\n                 startDisposable?.dispose();\\n@@ -387,7 +394,7 @@ export class TerminalHandler {\\n                 } else {\\n                     // this.terminal?.sendText(\"\\\\x03\");\\n                     // await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));\\n-                    shellIntegration.executeCommand(command);\\n+                    execution = shellIntegration.executeCommand(command);\\n                 }\\n             } else {\\n                 console.log(\\'no shell int\\')\\n```\\n\\nIt\\'s quite important that you do this since the next execution is not necessarily yours even in other cases, other extensions can also call executeCommand. The Python extension for example may try to activate a virtual environment when a terminal starts up to give a real world example.',\n",

An execution is basically a combination of prompt+input+output, and for the problem cases, the first \"execution\" is the comment since the REPL has determined it\\'s not a multi-line command. Generally, it\\'s the job of the extension to make sure this does not happen.\\n\\nHowever I might be able to improve the situation in some cases by using either bracketed paste mode or triggering shift+enter in pwsh may help this. Ultimately, the shell may decide to execute them on separate lines though. Digging into history a bit, bracketed paste mode is NOT used when executing a command because of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/4d11494d118391dabf9c4e4c43b5f11ed6160710 and I can\\'t remember why I decided to do that. Little afraid to change that tbh 😅 \\n\\nI\\'ll have a look into whether we can be a little smarter around having sub-executions all managed internally, so we could link the command and the following command to the same thing.',\n",

Compiler requirements for newer Node.js versions and the security push inside Microsoft will make it harder to support across all three architectures of the legacy server with the current sysroots.\\n \\n> Will support be going away at the *beginning* or the *end* of February?\\n \\nSupport will be removed in beginning of March 2025. February release of VS Code will be the last version to support legacy server\\n \\n> Will you be making an explicit change to disable legacy compatibility? Currently, there are a number of elements in play--the legacy server, a special `/tmp/vscode-skip-server-requirements-check` check, shell script checks, checks written in Rust, etc.\\n \\nYes, the following changes will be made:\\na) Removal of the pipeline that builds the legacy server https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/build/azure-pipelines/linux/product-build-linux-legacy-server.yml\\nb) Update the checks in cli https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/cli/src/util/prereqs.rs to exit with an error on platforms that used legacy server\\nc) Drop the support for legacy server use in the version check script https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a77885d9e879023f87c852d5f089efb1399a3e75/resources/server/bin/helpers/check-requirements-linux.sh#L14\\n \\n> Would you be willing to provide a draft release with your planned changes so that we can be proactive in evaluating workarounds?\\n \\nYes, this is a reasonable ask, we can provide a custom insiders build to test by December.',\n",
